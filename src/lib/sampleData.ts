I own a Google Pixel 9. My wife owns an iPhone 16. We've been using them side by side for months. I've run benchmarks, compared cameras, tested battery life, analyzed the ecosystems, and after all that exhaustive research, I have reached one definitive conclusion:

**The iPhone wins, because my wife said so.**

    content: `## The New Great Game

The Indo-Pacific isn't just a geographic region anymore — it's the chessboard where the future of global power is being decided.

### The Key Players

**The United States** is doubling down on its Indo-Pacific strategy, strengthening alliances with Japan, South Korea, Australia, and India through frameworks like QUAD and AUKUS.

**China** continues its assertive posture in the South China Sea while building economic leverage through the Belt and Road Initiative. The question isn't whether China is a superpower — it's what kind of superpower it wants to be.

**India** is playing a fascinating balancing act — maintaining strategic autonomy while deepening ties with both the West and Russia. The "multi-alignment" strategy is pragmatic but risky.

### The Semiconductor Factor

Taiwan sits at the heart of this power struggle, not just geographically but technologically. **TSMC produces over 60% of the world's advanced semiconductors.** Control over Taiwan isn't just about territory — it's about controlling the backbone of modern technology.

### What I Think

The Indo-Pacific will define the 21st century the way the Atlantic defined the 20th. Here's my take:

1. **Economic interdependence** makes full-scale conflict unlikely but doesn't prevent it
2. **Technology is the new oil** — whoever leads in AI, semiconductors, and quantum computing leads the world
3. **Middle powers matter more than ever** — countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines are no longer passive players
4. **Climate change is a threat multiplier** — rising sea levels will displace millions in this region

### The Bottom Line

We're witnessing a once-in-a-century power transition. It won't be smooth, but understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone who wants to understand where the world is heading.`,

    content: `## The Overlooked Continent

When people talk about emerging markets, they think China, India, Southeast Asia. Africa rarely makes the list. That's a mistake.

### The Numbers Don't Lie

- **1.4 billion people** — the youngest population on Earth (median age: 19)
- **8 of the 15 fastest-growing economies** in the world are in Africa
- **AfCFTA** (African Continental Free Trade Area) creates a single market of 1.3 billion people
- **$3.4 trillion combined GDP** — larger than India's a decade ago

### The Tech Revolution

Africa is leapfrogging traditional development paths:

- **M-Pesa** proved mobile money could work at scale before Apple Pay existed
- **Flutterwave and Paystack** are building pan-African payment infrastructure
- **Andela** is training world-class developers
- **Jumia** is building e-commerce infrastructure where none existed

### Challenges Are Real

Let's be honest about the hurdles:

1. **Infrastructure gaps** — power, roads, internet connectivity
2. **Political instability** in certain regions
3. **Brain drain** — talented people leaving for opportunities abroad
4. **Corruption** remains a systemic issue in some nations

### My Take

Africa in 2026 reminds me of Southeast Asia in 2010. The infrastructure is being built, the talent is there, and the market size is undeniable. Smart investors are already positioning themselves.

> The question isn't whether Africa will rise — it's which countries and sectors will lead the way.

Keep an eye on **Nigeria, Kenya, Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Ghana**. These are the ones to watch.`,

    content: `## The Goal: Monthly Passive Income

I started investing in dividend stocks 3 years ago with one goal: **build a portfolio that pays me every month.** Here's how I did it and what I learned.

### The Strategy

Most US companies pay dividends quarterly. The trick is to own companies that pay in **different months**:

- **January, April, July, October**: Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola
- **February, May, August, November**: Microsoft, Apple
- **March, June, September, December**: Procter & Gamble, Realty Income

By staggering, I receive dividends every single month.

### My Portfolio Allocation

\`\`\`
Dividend Aristocrats:     40%
REITs:                    20%
High-Yield Dividend ETFs: 20%
Growth + Dividend:        15%
International Dividend:    5%
\`\`\`

### Key Metrics I Track

1. **Dividend Yield**: How much income per dollar invested (target: 3-5%)
2. **Payout Ratio**: What % of earnings goes to dividends (below 60% is healthy)
3. **Dividend Growth Rate**: How fast dividends increase year over year
4. **Years of Consecutive Increases**: Stability indicator

### What I Learned the Hard Way

- **Don't chase yield.** A 10% yield often means the company is in trouble
- **DRIP is magic.** Dividend reinvestment compounds beautifully
- **Diversification matters.** I once had 30% in one REIT — bad idea
- **Tax-advantaged accounts first.** Dividends in a taxable account hurt

### Current Results

After 3 years of consistent investing:
- **Monthly dividend income**: ~$340/month
- **Portfolio value**: ~$120,000
- **Average yield**: 3.4%
- **Year-over-year dividend growth**: 8%

It's not life-changing money yet, but watching that number grow every month is incredibly motivating.

### Getting Started

If you're starting from zero:

1. Open a brokerage account (Fidelity or Schwab — both are free)
2. Start with a dividend ETF like **SCHD** or **VIG**
3. Invest consistently — even $100/month adds up
4. Reinvest all dividends
5. Be patient — this is a decade-long game

    content: `## The Experiment

Five years ago, I split my investment portfolio 50/50: half in **S&P 500 index funds**, half in **individual stocks** I hand-picked. Here are the honest results.

### The Scoreboard

| Metric | Index Fund (VTI) | My Stock Picks |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| 5-Year Return | +62% | +48% |
| Time Spent | 0 hours/month | 5-10 hours/month |
| Stress Level | Zero | Medium-High |
| Best Year | +26% (2023) | +41% (2023) |
| Worst Year | -18% (2022) | -31% (2022) |

**The index fund won.** Not just on returns, but on *risk-adjusted returns* and *time efficiency.*

### Why Stock Picking Is Harder Than You Think

1. **Survivorship bias**: You hear about the guy who bought NVIDIA at $20. You don't hear about the 1,000 people who bought the next "sure thing" and lost.

2. **Information asymmetry**: By the time news reaches you, institutional investors have already priced it in.

3. **Emotions are real**: I sold Apple in 2022 during the dip because I panicked. It's up 80% since then.

### When Individual Stocks Make Sense

I'm not saying never buy individual stocks. They make sense if:

- You genuinely enjoy researching companies
- You have a long time horizon (10+ years)
- You limit it to 10-20% of your portfolio
- You can stomach 30-50% drawdowns without selling

### My Current Approach

After this experiment, here's how I invest now:

\`\`\`
80% — Index funds (VTI, VXUS, BND)
15% — Individual stocks (companies I deeply understand)
 5% — Speculative bets (crypto, IPOs, etc.)
\`\`\`

### The Boring Truth

The best investment strategy is the one you'll **actually stick with** for 20+ years. For most people, that's index funds on autopilot.

Set up automatic investments, stop checking your portfolio daily, and go live your life. Your future self will thank you.

    content: `## The Free Full-Stack Setup

You don't need to pay for servers, databases, or hosting to build a production-ready web app in 2026. Here's how.

### The Stack

- **Next.js** — React framework with SSR, routing, and API routes
- **Supabase** — PostgreSQL database + auth + storage (free tier is generous)
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first styling
- **Vercel/Netlify** — Free hosting with auto-deploy

### Step 1: Project Setup

\`\`\`bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --app
cd my-app
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Supabase Configuration

Create a \`.env.local\` file:

\`\`\`env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
\`\`\`

Create the Supabase client:

\`\`\`typescript
// src/lib/supabase.ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

export const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
);
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Database Schema

In the Supabase dashboard, create your tables using the SQL editor:

\`\`\`sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE posts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
\`\`\`

### Step 4: Fetching Data

\`\`\`typescript
// In a Server Component
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase';

export default async function PostsPage() {
  const { data: posts } = await supabase
    .from('posts')
    .select('*')
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false });

  return (
    <div>
      {posts?.map(post => (
        <article key={post.id}>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          <p>{post.content}</p>
        </article>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
\`\`\`

### Key Takeaways

1. **Supabase's free tier** gives you 500MB database, auth for 50K users, and 1GB storage
2. **Server Components** in Next.js mean you can query the database directly — no API routes needed
3. **Row Level Security** is crucial — always enable it
4. The whole stack is **free** until you have serious traffic

This is the stack I used to build this very blog. It's fast, free, and scales when you need it to.`,

    content: `## My Journey from JS to TS

I resisted TypeScript for a long time. "Why do I need types? JavaScript is fine!" — me, 2 years ago, before spending 3 hours debugging a \`undefined is not a function\` error.

### The Pain Points of JavaScript

\`\`\`javascript
// What could go wrong?
function processUser(user) {
  return user.name.toUpperCase();
}

// Everything. Everything could go wrong.
processUser(null);        // 💥 Cannot read properties of null
processUser({ naam: "test" }); // 💥 undefined is not a function
processUser(42);          // 💥 user.name is undefined
\`\`\`

### The TypeScript Version

\`\`\`typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
}

function processUser(user: User): string {
  return user.name.toUpperCase();
}

// All of these are caught at compile time ✅
processUser(null);              // ❌ Type error
processUser({ naam: "test" }); // ❌ Type error
processUser(42);                // ❌ Type error
\`\`\`

### What Changed My Mind

1. **IDE autocomplete**: TypeScript + VSCode gives you autocomplete that feels like a superpower. No more guessing API response shapes.

2. **Refactoring confidence**: Renaming a property? TypeScript shows you every file that needs updating. Instantly.

3. **Self-documenting code**: Types ARE documentation. A well-typed function tells you exactly what it expects and returns.

4. **Catch bugs before runtime**: About 40% of the bugs I used to find in testing are now caught by the compiler.

### Tips for Getting Started

- Start with \`strict: false\` in tsconfig and gradually enable strict checks
- Use \`any\` temporarily — but always come back to fix it
- Learn utility types: \`Partial<T>\`, \`Pick<T>\`, \`Omit<T>\` are game-changers
- Don't over-type — let TypeScript infer when it can

### The Verdict

TypeScript adds maybe 10% more code but prevents 40% of bugs and makes you 2x faster at navigating large codebases. The ROI is insane.

If you're still on the fence, just try it for one project. You won't go back.`,
